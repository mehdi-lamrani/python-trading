### Python Trading Engine ###

The goal of this workshop is to devise a very basic trading engine.
The business analyst of a trading firm handed you the UML Diagram of the portfolio trading engine and asked you to deliver a quick prototype.

**TODO** : Write the code for the main classes with the right attributes and methods, and a main class that tests the engine.
You can chose to implement a minimalistic text-based interaction to get the user input, or go for a web client or a python gui if you feel like doing it.
